# 📊 My Journey Learning Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

## 🚀 Overview
I learned **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Python, which is basically checking out data, understanding it, and finding patterns or trends.  

In this repo, I practiced **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis** using **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.

## 🧩 What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Univariate Analysis
I learned that univariate analysis is all about **one variable at a time**.  
It helps me see the distribution and central values of the data.  

- **Data Types I worked with:**
  - **Numerical:** age, height, weight, price, etc.  
  - **Categorical:** gender, country, category, etc.  

- **Visualizations I tried:**
  - **📊 Bar Plot / Count Plot:** To count categories  
  - **🥧 Pie Chart:** To see proportions  
  - **📈 Histogram:** Frequency distribution for numbers  
  - **🌊 Distribution Plot (KDE/Distplot):** Density distribution  
  - **📦 Box Plot:** To quickly see min, max, median, quartiles, and outliers  

- **Stats I calculated:**  
  Minimum, Maximum, Mean, Skewness — these helped me understand the data better.

### 2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis
I learned that bivariate analysis looks at **two variables together** to understand relationships.  

- **Numerical vs Numerical:**
  - **🔹 Scatter Plot:** Check correlation  
  - **📉 Line Plot:** Useful for trends or time-based data  

- **Categorical vs Numerical:**
  - **📊 Bar Plot:** Compare numbers across categories  
  - **📦 Box Plot:** Compare distributions  
  - **🌊 KDE Plot:** Compare density distributions  

- **Categorical vs Categorical:**
  - **🗺️ Heatmap:** Count or check relationships  
  - **📑 GroupBy:** Summarize data by category

### 3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis
I learned that multivariate analysis looks at **three or more variables together**.  

- **Enhanced Scatter Plots:** Add **hue**, **size**, or **style** to show more info  
- **Multivariate Bar Plots:** Compare a third category using **hue**  
- **Pair Plots:** Check relationships between multiple numerical variables  
- **Clustermap & Pivot Tables:** See trends and patterns across multiple features

## 🛠️ Libraries I Used
- **🐼 pandas**: For handling and analyzing data  
- **📈 seaborn**: For making attractive statistical plots  
- **🖌️ matplotlib**: For customizing plots

## 💡 What I Learned Overall
- Univariate analysis helps me understand each variable.  
- Bivariate analysis shows how two variables relate.  
- Multivariate analysis helps spot complex patterns.  
- Visualizations make trends, outliers, and patterns easier to see.  
- Using **plots + stats** together gives a solid understanding of data.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Practice **feature engineering** based on EDA insights  
- Apply EDA to bigger, real-world datasets  
- Learn **statistical tests** to validate insights  
- Connect EDA with **machine learning projects**
